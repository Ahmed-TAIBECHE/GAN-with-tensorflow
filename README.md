# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Implementation

This project aims to implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to gain a concrete understanding of their theory and practical application.

## Project Goals

* Implement a functional GAN model from scratch.
* Explore the training dynamics and challenges associated with GANs.
* Generate realistic images resembling the target dataset.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Fashion-MNIST dataset from TensorFlow Datasets (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist), which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of various clothing articles.


* `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the implemented GAN code, along with explanations and visualizations.
* `reports/figures`: Houses the loss function plot generated during training.
* `dataset`:
    * `raw`: Stores original images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
    * `interim`: Holds samples generated by the untrained generator during experimentation.
    * `processed`: Contains images generated throughout the training process.
    * `external`: Stores the final generated images, representing the project's output.

## Understanding GANs

GANs are a powerful class of deep learning models that consist of two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to create realistic data samples that resemble the target distribution, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real data and the generator's outputs. This adversarial training process pushes both networks to improve iteratively: the generator learns to create more convincing samples, and the discriminator becomes better at detecting forgeries.

This project delves into the implementation details of a GAN, providing insights into its training procedure and the challenges that can arise, such as mode collapse and vanishing gradients. 

## Getting Started

To run the experiments and explore the generated images, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` folder. These notebooks will guide you through the setup process and the training steps.

## Additional Notes

* Feel free to modify and experiment with the code provided in the notebooks to explore different GAN architectures and hyperparameters.
* Consider incorporating additional visualizations (e.g., tensorboard) to monitor training progress and gain deeper understanding of the model's behavior.

By following these steps and referencing the provided materials, you can effectively utilize this project to learn about and implement GANs.
